   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Creating Solids from Scratch</SPAN><BR>
   Creating solids is quite simple. The process always follows the same 
   four basic steps:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select the Block tool.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">In the <A HREF="New_Objects.htm">New Objects</A> 
    dialog, select Primitives in the Categories box. In the Objects 
    selection box you will have 5 options. Select any one of these objects:</P>
   <UL TYPE="disc">
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     block<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">wedge<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">cylinder<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">spike<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">arch</P>
    </UL>
   <P>
    <B>Note:</B> The arch primitive is a special case. It is not actually 
    a primitive object, but an Arch tool which allows you to quickly and 
    easily make multi-piece arches. For more information on the Arch 
    tool, see <A HREF="Using_the_Arch_Tool.htm">Using the Arch Tool</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Drag a box in a 2D view, making sure it is the correct size and in 
    the correct position in each of the views.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Press Enter to create the solid.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Creating Solids by Cloning</SPAN><BR>
   Cloning provides a simple way to quickly duplicate an object or group 
   of objects. This includes both brushes and entities, and groups can 
   contain a mixture of both.</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Go into Selection mode by pressing Shift+S.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Select the object (brush, entity, or group of 
    brushes and/or entities) that you would like to clone.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Hold shift, and click and drag the selected object 
    to its new position with the left mouse button.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">While shift is still being held, release the mouse 
    button. The object has now been cloned.</P>
   </OL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Prefabs</SPAN><BR>
   Once you have a prefab library created (see <A HREF="Creating_and_Using_Prefabs.htm">Creating
    and Using Prefabs</A>), it is a simple task to insert a prefab into 
   your level.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   There are two ways to put a prefab into your level.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   The simple method is, from the <A HREF="New_Objects.htm">New Objects</A> 
   dialog, to select the prefab library from the Categories selection 
   box, and the specific prefab from the Object selection box, and then 
   press the Insert original prefab button. This will insert the 
   selected prefab in the center of the 2D views. You can do this with 
   either the Selection or Block tool selected. Simply move it around 
   into place. (Make sure Texture Locking is turned on!)</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   The second way to insert a prefab is with the Block tool. Press 
   Shift+B to go into block mode, then create a box the same approximate 
   size you want the prefab to be. Select the prefab library and prefab 
   object as described above. Now press enter to create the prefab. This 
   will create prefabs at any size you specify, rather than inserting 
   them at original size then requiring you to resize them manually.</P>
