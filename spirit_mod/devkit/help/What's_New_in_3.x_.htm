    with running Hammer and Half-Life at the same time causing the editor

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Version 3.3</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Highlights:</SPAN><BR>
   The editor has been given a facelift, with a completely rewritten 
   OpenGL renderer for the 3D views. This enables the addition of engine 
   rendering code for previews of such things as sprites and glow 
   effects. Texturing, normally the most time-consuming aspect of 
   mapmaking, has also been streamlined. And, a number of other 
   productivity-enhancing features have taken the most common hitches 
   out of mapmaking.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">OpenGL 3D Renderer</SPAN></FONT>.
     The real-time renderer is much faster, more robust, and allows for 
    animating visuals in the 3D view.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Texture
     Locking</SPAN></FONT>. Texture alignment is now preserved through 
    rotation, scaling, and flipping, allowing for the hassle-free 
    construction of odd-angled geometry.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Powerful
     Texture Application Features</SPAN></FONT>. Automatic texture 
    continuity is guaranteed when lifting and applying from one face to 
    another. Textures can be fit across one face or multiple faces, or 
    aligned to the left, right, top, bottom, and center of faces with a 
    single button click. Textures can be projected onto faces from an 
    arbitrary viewpoint, useful for texturing cliff faces or other 
    irregular geometry. In addition, texture axes are now displayed in 
    the 3D view.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Sprite
     Preview</SPAN></FONT>. Sprites are now automatically previewed in 
    the 3D view, along with animation. Frame rate and scale key values 
    are correctly reflected in the preview, eliminating the need to 
    compile and run the map in the game engine when placing sprites.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Features:</SPAN><BR>
   Aside from the above highlights, there have been a number of smaller 
   changes as well.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Go To Brush Number</FONT>.</SPAN> 
    Brushes can now be found by entity / brush number for fast tracking 
    down of compiler errors.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Iconic
     Entities</FONT>.</SPAN> Any point entity can be set to render as a 
    sprite icon in the 3D view through a specification in the FGD file, 
    making it easy to distinguish between different entities in the 3D view.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">3D
     Preview of Tools</FONT><FONT COLOR="BLACK">.</FONT></SPAN> The brush 
    creation, clipper, cordon bounds, and selection tools all render in 
    the 3D view in real time, taking the guesswork out of previously 
    painstaking operations.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Colored
     Solid Entities</SPAN></FONT>. Solid entities can now be given a 
    render color in the FGD file, for easier identification in the 2D or 
    3D views.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">3D
     Grid</SPAN></FONT>. A new 3D grid allows for easy visualization of 
    brush sizes in the 3D view.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Missing
     Texture Replacement</SPAN></FONT>. Added a Replace button to the 
    texture bar, making it easy to replace textures when they are missing 
    from the WAD file.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Texture
     Usage Report</SPAN></FONT>. Statistics on unique textures, total 
    texture memory, and WADs used in are reported in the Map Information dialog<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Enhanced
     Camera Controls</SPAN></FONT>. Real-time keyboard sampling gives 
    smooth camera movement in the 3D view. Holding down both mouse 
    buttons now enables dollying the camera forward and back. The mouse 
    wheel now zooms both the 2D and 3D views.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Point
     and Click Entity Placement</SPAN></FONT>. Point entities can now be 
    placed directly in the 3D view just by pointing and clicking.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Entity
     Key Browse Button</FONT></SPAN>. Added a browse button to the Entity 
    Properties dialog for typo-free setting of sprite, sound, and model keys.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Clipper
     Measurements</SPAN></FONT>. Sizes of clipped brushes can be 
    displayed in the 2D view while clipping. This is useful for clipping 
    brushes to a particular size, or for matching with a specific texture.</P>
