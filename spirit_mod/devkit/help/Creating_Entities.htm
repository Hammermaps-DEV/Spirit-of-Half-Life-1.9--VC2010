  <P>
   Entities give life to your level. They are the monsters, doors, 
   switches and lights that turn your static architecture into an 
   interactive environment. Careful use of entities is critical to 
   creating an interesting, unique and fun level for others to play.</P>
  <P>
   Unlike solids, entities are not created within the editor. Most users 
   will simply choose from a pre-existing set of entities provided with 
   Half-Life. Once you have selected the appropriate entity, the editor 
   gives you control over its placement and other properties.</P>
  <P>
   There are two types of entities: point-based and brush-based.</P>
  <P>
   Point-based entities exist only at a certain exact point. Examples 
   include lights, monsters, and player start points. (Monsters <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">do</SPAN> 
   have an area, but it is defined by the game code and is not 
   modifiable from within the map.) Some point type entities are just 
   that: points. For example, the env_beam entity, which controls 
   Half-Life's beam effects, uses two info_target entities as targets 
   and the beam of light runs between these two points.</P>
  <P>
   Brush-based entities are entities that depend on either a brush for 
   their physical presence (like doors, trains, and other moving 
   entities) or an &quot;area&quot; (like triggers, which require an 
   activation field).</P>

    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip</SPAN>: You will most likely 
    need to edit the entity properties after you place a point-based 
    entity. Select the entity and press Alt-Enter to view the entities 
    properties dialog box. This dialog pops up automatically for 
    brush-based entities.</P>
