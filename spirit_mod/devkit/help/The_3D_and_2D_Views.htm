  <P>
   Before you can begin creating and placing solids and entities, you 
   need to familiarize yourself with the editor's interface. By default, 
   your working area is divided into 4 sections. The first (top, left) 
   window is the 3D View, and the rest are the 2D views.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">The 3D View</SPAN><BR>
   The 3D window is a dynamic 3D space where you can view your level 
   from any angle. This is critical for checking textures and texture 
   alignment, spotting leaks and just getting a sense of what your 
   finished level will look like.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Using Cameras</SPAN><BR>
   To take advantage of the 3D view, you need to be able to place 
   cameras. Cameras determine your vantage point(s). Hammer provides you 
   with precise control over the camera movements in your map.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/camera1.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="77" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   A camera in Hammer (as displayed in the 2D views) consists of two 
   parts: the eye, and the viewing angle, which is represented by a line 
   extending out from the eye. The length of the line that represents 
   the viewing angle is not important, though it can help you aim the 
   camera exactly at an object.</P>
  <P>
   While it is possible to move a single camera all over the map each 
   time you need to look at something new in the 3D window, it is more 
   convenient to have easy access to multiple cameras placed throughout 
   the map. Hammer allows you to easily cycle through multiple cameras 
   by pressing PageUp and PageDown.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Camera Placement</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Placing cameras in Hammer is 
   extremely simple. First, switch to Camera mode by pressing Shift+C, 
   then h</SPAN>old Shift and with the left mouse button, click-drag a 
   line in one of the 2D views. This will create a thin red line with a 
   large dot at one end. The dot is the camera's position, and this is 
   where the 3D camera view will originate. The red line is the camera's 
   viewing angle. You can adjust either end of the line to change the 
   view. Follow the above steps to create as many cameras in your level 
   as you need.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note: </SPAN>There are a number of 
    options available to you when using multiple cameras. You must have 
    the Camera tool selected to take advantage of these:</P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">PageUp: </SPAN>cycle up to the next 
     camera position<BR>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">PageDn: </SPAN>cycle down to the 
     last camera position<BR>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Delete: </SPAN>delete the current 
     camera position<BR>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Shift: </SPAN>hold shift and 
     click-drag with the left mouse button to create a new camera.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : bold;">Tip: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">While
     in camera mode, you can adjust the camera position by moving the eye 
    or viewing angle in any of the 2d windows.</SPAN></P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Mouselook/NoClip Style Movement</SPAN><BR>
   Version 2.1 of Hammer introduced a new style of 3D View movement 
   called mouselook movement. It is designed to be the same as when you 
   are in the game and walking around with +mlook (mouselook) and the 
   NoClip cheat both turned on. It can be enabled or disabled by 
   pressing (lowercase) z.</P>
  <P>
   Moving your mouse around will change the player's direction of focus, 
   while W and S control forward and backward movement, and A and D 
   control sided to side (left and right strafing) movement.</P>
  <P>
   The old style keyboard shortcuts (listed below) still work. You can 
   disable this new movement style by going into the 3D View options and 
   disabling use mouselook navigation.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Keyboard Shortcuts</SPAN><BR>
   There are a number of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to quickly 
   maneuver through the 3D view without switching to the Camera tool.</P>
  <P>
   While holding the spacebar:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    holding the left mouse button allows you to rotate your angle of view 
    in any direction, while the viewing point remains stationary.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">holding the right mouse button will allow you to 
    move left, right, up, and down while keeping the viewing angle constant.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">holding the left <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;"> 
    right buttons and moving the mouse causes the view to strafe forward, 
    backward, right, and left. (note that this makes the following 
    behavior redundant).</SPAN></P>
