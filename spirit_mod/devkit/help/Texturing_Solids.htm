  <P>
   Textures are the designs applied to the surfaces of solids. These 
   textures show what material a given solid is made of (brick, steel, 
   sand, etc.). So, while solids give your level form, textures indicate 
   function, create atmosphere and bring your level to life. Skilled 
   application of textures is one of the most important aspects of 
   creating a good level. The Valve Hammer Editor's tools give you easy 
   access to all of the texture properties.</P>
  <P>
   Half-Life's textures are stored in WAD files. A WAD file is a 
   collection (a wad) of textures that the compile tools use to put 
   textures into the compiled map. Texture WADs can be added and removed 
   from the <A HREF="Textures.htm">Textures options</A>.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: the WAD file dates all 
    the way back to Doom. Doom uses the WAD format to store complete 
    level information, including map, textures, monsters, etc.</P>
   <P>
    When Quake came along, the WAD format changed into the WAD2 format. 
    WAD2 is less of an essential game file than it is a design file. It 
    is used to store 8-bit single-palette textures. During the compile 
    process, the compile tools take textures from a WAD2 and place them 
    directly into the compiled map files.</P>
   <P>
    Half-Life uses the WAD3 format. It is essentially the same as the 
    WAD2 format, except that each texture stored includes its own 
    palette. This allows for a much richer color depth than previous 
    texture systems.</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
   Your first encounter with textures will most likely be through the <A HREF="Textures_toolbar.htm">Textures</A> toolbar.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/toolbar_textures.gif" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="192" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="Textures_toolbar.htm">Textures</A> toolbar shows the 
   current texture, and lets you select a new texture. The Current 
   texture drop-down list shows the last eight textures used, then 
   continues with a list of the remaining textures. Use the Texture 
   group scrollbox to view a different subset of textures. You will have 
   a choice between viewing all textures, or viewing individual texture 
   WAD3 files. (A WAD3 file is a file that contains a group of Half-Life 
   textures). You can add or remove WAD3 files in the <A HREF="Textures.htm">Textures
    Options</A> dialog.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Texture Browser</SPAN><BR>
   The Browse... button opens the texture browser, where you can select 
   from all available textures (as dictated by the Texture Group setting).</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/texture_browser.gif" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="431" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The Size scroll box allows you to set the displayed size of the 
   textures. You can choose from 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, or 1:1 (full size).</P>
  <P>
   The Filter dialog box allows you to type in a search string. Any 
   texture that includes that string as part of its name will be 
   displayed. You can specify more than one filter string. For example, 
   if you specify the search string &quot;sign 7,&quot; any texture with 
   &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;7&quot; in its name will be displayed. 
   Previous search strings can be accessed by clicking on the down arrow.</P>
  <P>
   The Only used textures option tells the browser to display only those 
   textures that have been used in your level. This helps you limit your 
   use of different textures, and avoid using different textures for the 
   same purpose. For games such as Half-Life, textures are stored in the 
   compiled maps. Reducing the number of textures will decrease the 
   compiled map size. Fewer textures to load also means memory savings 
   while playing the map in the game.</P>
  <P>
   The Mark button allows you to mark (select) all texture faces that 
   contain the selected texture. You can then adjust those faces as 
   required (textures, surface attributes, etc). This is best used in 
   conjunction with the Face Properties dialog. If the normal Apply 
   Textures map tool is used, any brush with one face selected will have 
   the new texture applied to every face of the brush.</P>
  <P>
   The Replace button (also accessible through the Tools menu) will 
   bring up the <A HREF="Replace_Textures.htm">Replace Textures</A> dialog.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Texture Application Mode</SPAN><BR>
   You will eventually need to modify a texture in some way. The Face 
   Properties dialog (Texture Application mode) allows you to manipulate 
   the texture properties of selected brush faces. To select a brush 
   face, click on it in the 3D view with the left mouse button. To 
   select multiple faces, hold down the Ctrl key while you do this. You 
   can also select multiple brushes <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">before</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;"> 
   bringing up the Face Properties tool.</SPAN></P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/dialog_face_properties.gif" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="430" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Scale (X/Y)</SPAN><BR>
   You can modify the scale of a texture to shrink or enlarge it. 
   Numbers less than 1 shrink, and numbers greater than 1 enlarge. You 
   can use negative values to mirror the texture in one or both planes.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Shift (X/Y)</SPAN><BR>
   This simply allows you to shift the texture around in the X and/or Y planes.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Rotation</SPAN><BR>
   Rotation allows you to rotate the texture on a brush face.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Justify</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">There are six buttons you can 
   press here: L (left), R (right), Fit (fit to face), T (top), B 
   (bottom), and C (center on face). These allow you to quickly and 
   easily align a texture on a brush.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Treat as one</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">If you have multiple faces 
   selected, you can check this option to treat all the faces as one 
   single face.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Align: World and Face</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">These checkboxes allow you to set 
   the texture alignment style for the selected faces. World alignment 
   causes textures to be aligned according to world coordinates (if 
   you're familiar with versions of the editor before 3.3, this was the 
   standard behavior). Face alignment uses the coordinates of the face 
   as a basis for alignment.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Texture Group</SPAN><BR>
   You can select which group of textures you want to use - either all 
   of them, or individual texture WADs.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Current Texture</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">The name of the current texture 
   is displayed here, along with a thumbnail picture of the texture.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Hide Mask</SPAN><BR>
   If this button is toggled on, the selected brush face(s) will not 
   appear as selected (with a reddish hue). This may make it easier to 
   perform some texture manipulations.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Mode</SPAN><BR>
   This lets you select what feature you want the left mouse button to 
   be. The available options are Lift+Select, Lift, Select, Apply 
   (texture only), Apply (texture + values).</P>
