   Even relatively modest levels can contain hundreds--even 
   thousands--of objects. Hammer offers two ways of keeping track of 
   items in your level: normal grouping and visibility grouping (VisGroups).</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;"> 
   VisGroup refers to &quot;visibility group&quot; and has nothing at 
   all to do with the Vis compile tool. VisGroups only affect what you 
   see in the editor and have no in-game effect.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Grouping</SPAN><BR>
   Normal grouping is used to literally &quot;glue&quot; things together.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>

  <P>
   The object shown above is made of eight brushes. If you were to click 
   on a single brush when the object is ungrouped, only that brush would 
   be selected; you'd have to ctrl-click each piece to select the whole 
   thing (or drag a selection box over the whole thing). When the object 
   is grouped, however, you can click on any individual brush to select 
   everything in entire group.</P>

   VisGroups stands for visibility groups. VisGroups make managing 
   objects easy by letting you control what you see on your screen. With 
   VisGroups, you can arbitrarily assign objects to a specific group; 
   you can then turn the visibility of that group on and off. Let's say 
   you have the following section in your map:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups1.gif" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="165" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   Now, you'd like to be able to make the furniture a group, but you 
   still want to move each piece around independently from the others. 
   This is precisely what VisGroups are good for.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups2.gif" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="165" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   First, select the furniture pieces, then click on the hide selected 
   objects button. This will do two things: hide the objects in the 2D 
   and 3D views, and create a new VisGroup with the selected objects.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups3.gif" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The new VisGroup will appear in the <A HREF="Filter_Control.htm">Filter
    Control</A> toolbar named after the number of objects it contains. 
   To change the name of the VisGroup to something more suitable, select 
   the VisGroup, then click on it again. You will be able to change the 
   name to whatever you like. You can also click to the left of the name 
   and a hand will appear next to the VisGroup. This is how you set 
   which VisGroups are visible and which are not. You must press the 
   Apply button for the changes to take effect.</P>
  <P>
   Some things you can do with the mouse in the <A HREF="Filter_Control.htm">Filter
    Control</A> toolbar:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    drag one group onto another group (this will cause the first group to 
    be merged with the second group, and the resulting group will keep 
    the name of the second)<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">drag a group out of the Filter Control dialog (this 
    will allow you to delete VisGroupings)</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If you make the furniture group visible, then select it and press the 
   Mark button, the group will be highlighted in the 2D and 3D views.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups4.gif" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="165" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The other two options available to you are Purge and Edit. Pressing 
   the Purge button removes any VisGroups from the Filter Control dialog 
   that do not actually contain any objects (which is possible if you 
   have deleted objects or made one VisGroup part of another).</P>
  <P>
   The Edit button brings up the Object Groups dialog.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups5.gif" WIDTH="357" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   This dialog allows you to change the name and color of existing 
   VisGroups, or delete them. Deleting the VisGroup does not actually 
   delete the group's objects, it just eliminates the VisGroup, making 
   them individual unlinked objects. You also have the option of 
   creating new (empty) VisGroups with the New Group button.</P>
  <P>
   The last way you can use VisGroups is through an object's <A HREF="Object_Properties_dialog.htm">properties</A>,
    in the VisGroup tab.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="gfx/visgroups6.gif" WIDTH="391" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The above dialog will also be a part of an entity's <A HREF="Object_Properties_dialog.htm">Properties</A> 
   dialog. To assign the object to a VisGroup, just select the 
   appropriate group. To remove the VisGrouping from this object, click 
   on (no group).</P>
