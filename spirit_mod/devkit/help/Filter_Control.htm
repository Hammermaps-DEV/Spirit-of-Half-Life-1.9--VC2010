   All VisGroups will be listed in this control toolbar<SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   VisGrouping is a powerful tool for limiting visible objects in the 
   map. This allows for much easier editing on large levels but does 
   required that you use the .RMF file type for saving your maps since 
   the .MAP format doesn't include the VisGroup information.</P>
  <P>
   VisGroups are created using the <A HREF="Map_Operations.htm#hide_and_unhide">Hide
    Selected and Hide Unselected</A> buttons on the <A HREF="Map_Operations.htm">Map
    Operations</A> toolbar. When a VisGroup is created, it is inserted 
   into the Filter Control dialog with a name of &quot;n objects&quot;, 
   where n is the number of objects in the VisGroup. The name can be 
   changed by clicking on the group, then clicking on it again (but not double-clicking!).</P>
  <P>
   There are a number of buttons that can be used in the Filter Control dialog:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Apply</SPAN> - 
    Will cause unselected VisGroups to become invisible in the 2D and 3D 
    views. Select a group by clicking just to the left of its name. A 
    small hand will appear.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Edit</SPAN> 
    - This allows you to edit the name and color of a VisGroup, as well 
    as add and remove new groups.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Mark</SPAN> 
    - This causes selected VisGroups to be highlighted in the 2D and 3D views.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Purge</SPAN> 
    - This will remove any groups from the VisGroup window that no longer 
    contain any objects.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: You can delete a 
   VisGroup from the list by dragging it out of the filter control 
   dialog window.</P>
  <P>
   Another feature of the Filter Control window is the ability to merge 
   two VisGroups. This is done by dragging one group on top of a second. 
   Hammer will ask if you want to combine the two groups, and if you do, 
   they will be merged and the first group will take on the VisGroup 
   properties (name, color) of the second group.</P>
  <P>

    and VisGrouping</A>.</P>
