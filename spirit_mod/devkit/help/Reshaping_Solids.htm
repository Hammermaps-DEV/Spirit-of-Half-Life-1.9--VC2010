   Once you've created a simple, textured solid, you can use Hammer's 
   tools for refining your work. These tools include vertex 
   manipulation, face splitting, clip planes and carving. Each of these 
   tools lets you customize your solids by modifying the basic shapes 
   you started with. You will find that you can achieve the same or 
   similar effect using different tools; some are just faster and easier 
   than others when it comes to making the precise change you are trying 
   to make.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A NAME="vertex_manipulation"></A>Vertex
    Manipulation</SPAN><BR>
   Vertex manipulation allows you to move individual vertices and edges 
   of a solid, easily creating irregular shapes. This lets you make 
   shapes that are impossible with plane clipping, and extremely 
   difficult to do with carving. Vertex manipulation is also is useful 
   for modifying specific pieces of a group of objects, where resizing 
   would interfere with other objects in the group.</P>

    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note: </SPAN>While Vertex 
    Manipulation makes the creation of new complex shapes easy, it also 
    make the creation of invalid shapes easy. Remember that concave 
    shapes are not valid within the editor.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Vertices and Edges</SPAN><BR>
   A vertex (or plural, vertices) is a corner of a solid. Moving one 
   vertex will not effect any other vertex, but it will change the 
   position of any edges associated with it. An edge is a point between 
   two vertices which, when moved, will change the position of its two 
   associated vertices, as well as their associated edges (no other 
   vertices are effected besides the first two).</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A NAME="face_splitting"></A>Face Splitting</SPAN><BR>
   Face splitting allows you to add additional faces to a brush. This is 
   a useful tool when you want to add complexity to an object in your 
   level. Simply select two opposing edges (fig. 3) and press Ctrl+F. 
   This will turn the two edges into vertices, and place a new edge 
   between them (fig.4).</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A NAME="vertex_scaling"></A>Vertex Scaling</SPAN><BR>
   Vertex scaling allows you to select a number of vertices and change 
   their scale in relation to each other. The process is quite simple.</P>

   Clip planes let you make a precise cut in a solid, dividing it into 
   two pieces. You then have the option of keeping one or both of the 
   resulting two solids. You may find using Clip Planes quicker and more 
   efficient than carving or vertex manipulation.</P>

   Version 3.3 of the Valve Hammer Editor added a feature to display the 
   size of the solid area of the clipped brush. This is useful if you're 
   trying to clip a brush to an exact size.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A NAME="carving"></A>Carving</SPAN><BR>
   In the editor, any solid can be used to carve a volume out of other 
   solids. For example, you can place a solid within the room's wall and 
   tell Hammer to subtract the solid from the wall -- effectively 
   punching a hole right through the wall! This feature is not limited 
   to using cubic shapes as a carving tool: any solid -- cylinders, 
   cubes and wedges -- can be used to carve other solids.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   While carving, especially with a cylinder, it is best to carve the 
   smallest areas possible. For example, if you attempt to create a hole 
   in a large wall using the cylinder, the editor will automatically 
   break the wall face into several pieces, something you don't want. 
   Instead, a more efficient way to carve would be to first carve a 
   square hole (the same size as the circle) and leave the square in 
   place. Then you can take the cylinder and carve a hole in the small 
   square. This will eliminate the splintering effect for the wall.</P>

    In this step, you have the object you want to carve into (in blue), 
    and the object you will be carving with (in red). The red object 
    should be selected.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Position the carving object so that it is where you 
    want the hole to be.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Press Ctrl+Shift+C, or right click on the selected 
    object and select Carve. You can also press the Carve button on the 
    MapOperations toolbar.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Either delete the object you used to make the 
    carve, or use it to fill the hole. (For example, use the piece carved 
    out of a doorway as the door.)</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note: </SPAN>In the picture above, 
   you can see that the cube (which was previously one object) is now 
   broken into 4 separate objects. This is because the game engine 
   cannot handle concave objects, and the editor has broken it into 
   convex pieces.</P>
